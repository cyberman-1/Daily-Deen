# 🌙 Daily Deen

**A digital sanctuary for your spiritual day.**

I built Daily Deen because I was tired of Islamic apps that felt like "services"—full of ads, tracking, and subscription pop-ups. I wanted a space that actually felt peaceful. Something that felt like a sanctuary, not a product.

It is completely free, open-source, and privacy-focused. No servers, no tracking, no noise. Just you and your Deen.

## 📖 The Story (Sadaqah Jariyah)

This project is deeply personal. I’ve intended it as a **Sadaqah Jariyah** (ongoing charity).

It was inspired by someone who brought me closer to my faith and changed my life for the better. My hope is that every time someone uses this to pray, read Quran, or find a moment of peace, it counts as a good deed for her, for me, and for our families.

## ✨ What’s Inside?

I tried to include the essentials for a modern Muslim without any of the bloat:

*   **Prayer Times:** Works via GPS or manual search. It saves the times locally so it’s ready the moment you open the page.
*   **The Noble Quran:** A clean, distraction-free reader with English translations.
*   **Serenity Station:** My personal favorite. A focus player with Lofi Quran, rain sounds, and soft nasheeds for studying or winding down.
*   **Heart Check-In:** If you’re feeling anxious, sad, or lost, this gives you a specific Dua or remedy from the Sunnah for that exact emotion.
*   **Qibla & Ramadan Mode:** Simple tools to help you find your way and track your fasts during the holy month.

## 🛠️ The Philosophy (and Tech)

I went "old school" with the build. No heavy frameworks, no React, no complex build steps. I wanted it to be as lightweight as possible.

*   **Vanilla JS, HTML, & CSS:** Just raw code and glassmorphism styling.
*   **Local Storage:** Your settings (location, theme, counters) stay on *your* device. Nothing ever touches a cloud database.
*   **APIs:** Powered by Aladhan (Prayer), AlQuran Cloud (Verses), and GitHub (Hadith).

**To run it yourself:** Just download the code and open `dailydeennocomments.html`. It runs right in your browser. No `npm install` required.

## 🤲 A Sincere Request

If this app helps you in any way, I don't need stars or donations. I only ask for one thing:

**Please make a Dua for me.**

I am hoping to marry the person who inspired this project. She hasn't accepted my proposal yet. Please ask Allah to soften our hearts, guide us to what is best, and—if it is written—facilitate a blessed, Halal union between us.

*"Rabbana hab lana min azwajina wa dhurriyatina qurrata a'yunin..."*
