# 🌙 Daily Deen

**A simple, beautiful dashboard for your spiritual day.**

I built this because I was tired of Islamic apps that were cluttered with ads, tracking, and subscriptions. I wanted a digital space that actually felt *peaceful*—something that felt like a sanctuary, not a service.

It's free, open-source, and privacy-focused. No servers, no tracking, just you and your Deen.

## 📖 Why I Built This (Sadaqah Jariyah)

This project is very close to my heart. It is intended as a **Sadaqah Jariyah** (ongoing charity).

I built this inspired by a specific person who brought me closer to my faith. My hope is that every time someone uses this to pray or read Quran, it counts as a good deed for her, for me, and for our families.

## ✨ What's Inside?

I tried to pack in everything a modern Muslim needs without the bloat:

* **📍 Prayer Times that actually work:** It uses your GPS or a manual city search. It saves the times to your phone so it loads instantly next time.
* **📖 The Noble Quran:** Clean, readable text with English translations. No distractions.
* **🎧 Serenity Station:** This is my favorite feature. It's a focus player with Lofi Quran, rain sounds, and soft nasheeds. Perfect for studying or falling asleep.
* **🧭 Qibla Finder:** A simple compass to find the Kaaba wherever you are.
* **❤️ Heart Check-In:** Feeling anxious? Sad? Lazy? Click the button, and it gives you a specific Dua/Remedy from the Sunnah for that exact emotion.
* **🌙 Ramadan Mode:** A toggle switch that changes the theme and adds trackers for Taraweeh and fasting.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

I kept it old school. No heavy frameworks, no React, no build steps. Just clean, raw code.

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structure and that "glass" look.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Handles all the logic, APIs, and caching.
* **Local Storage:** Your settings (location, theme, counters) stay on your device. Nothing is sent to a cloud database.

**APIs used:**
* *Aladhan* for Prayer Times.
* *AlQuran Cloud* for the verses.
* *GitHub* for the Hadith collections.

## 🚀 How to Run It Yourself

Since it's just a static site, you don't need to install anything complicated.

1.  **Download the code:** Clone this repo or just download the ZIP.
2.  **Open it:** Double-click `index.html`.
3.  **That's it.** It runs right in your browser.

If you want to host your own version, you can drag and drop the folder into **Vercel** or **GitHub Pages**.

## 🤲 A Personal Request

If you find this useful, I don't ask for money or "stars" on GitHub. I have a simple request:

**Please make a sincere Dua for me.**

I am currently hoping to marry the person who inspired this project. She hasn't accepted my proposal yet. Please ask Allah to soften our hearts, guide us to what is best, and facilitate a blessed, Halal union between us if it is written.

*"Rabbana hab lana min azwajina wa dhurriyatina qurrata a'yunin..."*
